Tensions between the factions are on the rise again. 
The Dustmen and the Doomguard have clashed over philosophical disputes concerning the nature of entropy and death. 
My role required me to intervene and mediate a ceasefire before the City Guard had to step in. 
Balancing these ideologies is like walking a razor's edge.
