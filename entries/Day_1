Today marks my first day as an overseer in Sigil.
The air buzzes with the chatter of a thousand different languages, some of which I can barely comprehend. 
My duty is to monitor the peace and manage the portals in my sector. 
I am stationed at the Ladys Ward, where the political elites and highborn dwell. 
The gravity of this responsibility weighs heavily on me.
